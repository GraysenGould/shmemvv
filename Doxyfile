# Doxyfile 1.9.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project

# All text after a `#' in the configuration file is considered a comment and
# will be ignored

# The format is:
#   TAG = value [value, ...]

# All values after a tag are space or comma separated.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "A V&V suite for OpenSHMEM implementations."
